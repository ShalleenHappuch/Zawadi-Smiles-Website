								<h2>We are commited to reducing healthcare-related poverty.</h2>
								<p>Zawadi Smiles is built on the belief that every individual, regardless of location or economic status, deserves access to quality healthcare. As a Christian humanitarian organization, we are dedicated to addressing the healthcare challenges faced by underserved communities in Kenya. Our work focuses on providing sustainable, community-centered health solutions that make a real difference in the lives of those we serve. Our mission—"Caring for you, caring for our community"—goes beyond words. It embodies our core values of compassion, inclusivity, and commitment to justice in healthcare.</p>
								<p>Aligned with the global goal of achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030, Zawadi Smiles is committed to providing healthcare at zero cost to the patient. We ensure that our services remain accessible, particularly for those in remote or marginalized regions, by partnering with local health authorities, non-profit organizations, and global donors to bring quality healthcare to those who need it most. Through our community health initiatives, we are bridging the gap between healthcare needs and the resources required to meet them. Our efforts extend beyond immediate medical care to include preventive services, health education, and long-term solutions to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure in Africa.</p>
								<h2>Other featured programs</h2>
								<p>Immunization campaigns:Zawadi Smiles is supporting the Ministry of Health in strengthening the Kenya Expanded Program for Immunization campaigns in pastoralist inhabited areas by tracing immunization defaulters and funding acquisition of vaccines where shortage is reported.Zawadi Smiles is also sensitising the community on importance of children getting vaccinated through the work of well trained Community Health Promoters/Volunteers. Our work is aimed at improving vaccination rates and reducing morbidity. Post-malaria care for children:Malaria remains one of the leading causes of death in children under five in Kenya. While treatment exists, many children do not receive follow-up care, which is crucial for full recovery. Through trained CHPs, Zawadi Smiles will offer post-malaria care to ensure children regain full health, providing medications, nutritional support, and regular check-ups to monitor recovery.This is very important especially in cases of severe malaria.</p>
