											<h2>About us</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Zawadi Smiles is a Christian humanitarian organization committed to strengthening primary healthcare for underserved communities in Kenya and across Africa. Our mission, expressed through our tagline, “Caring for you, caring for our community,” drives us to address healthcare disparities and improve access to essential health services. Our approach centers on three pillars: reducing morbidity and mortality, providing care at your doorstep, and leveraging electronic health records (EHR) to enhance service delivery. Aligned with the global objective of achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030, Zawadi Smiles focuses on community health initiatives that ensure zero-cost healthcare to the patient and accessible healthcare for all, particularly those in marginalized regions.

									<h2>Recent Success Story</h2>
									<p>On September 6th, we organised a medical camp in a marginalised region of Kenya, a borderpost town between Kenya and Tanzania in the ASAL region - Namanga in Kajiado County, where we screened over 500 patients. Beyond providing free glasses and medications, we diagnosed 23 patients with cataracts, including a two-year-old boy who has never seen since<br />
									birth. We are now working on organising surgeries to restore their vision, showcasing how our efforts directly change lives.</p>

								<p class="content">Zawadi Smiles has dedicated its efforts to addressing primary healthcare in underserved communities in Kenya e.g. pastoralist communities. These communities, largely dependent on firewood for cooking, often suffer from various eye conditions caused by prolonged exposure to smoke, such as cataracts and chronic eye irritations. Limited access to clean energy alternatives, paired with a lack of financial resources, means that many individuals are unable to seek proper medical treatment.Our medical outreach focuses on providing essential eye care services, including screenings, treatment.</p>
					                        <p class="content">and surgery for conditions like cataracts. We collaborate with trained Community Health Promoters and Lions Hospital to identify and treat patients in need of urgent eye care. Beyond medical interventions, we work on sensitizing the community about preventive measures and the importance of eye health. Through partnerships with donors and healthcare professionals, Zawadi Smiles ensures that these marginalized communities receive the eye care they deserve, all at zero cost to the patient thus improving the quality of life for individuals who otherwise might have remained underserved.</p>
